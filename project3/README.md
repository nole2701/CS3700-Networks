Our approach to this is mostly written in the project description and functions' comments, 
so firstly get the milestone to work by implementing update, data and dump properly. 
After that literally nothing special, just following the "Implementing your router" 
part of the project description with tons of debugging. 
The hardest challenge for us was the level-2 tests because we always weren't sure which part 
was giving us bad results, so we had tons of print statements and spent a lot of time on that. 
Coalesce and aggregation of course being the hardest part were very confusing at first, 
but eventually we got through that too. And as already mentioned, print statements were our 
debugging and testing.
