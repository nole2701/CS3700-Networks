The implementation of the commands were not too difficult as it is kind of similar to Project 1 (socket basics). The biggest hurdle in this assignment was figuring out what the program was supposed to do in the first place so I could implement it, and then figuring out how to do it.

I ended up using argv to parse arguments from the command line and send them to the corresponding operation function.

I tested my code by performing all the functions on the command line. For data transfer operations, I tested various files including .txt, mp3, and jpg.
